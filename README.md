An adobe air/actionscript app I worked on the train during a 4-day train ride from Toronto to Vancouver. The app shows approximately the location of the rider on a map. Due to the constraint of the trip, with no internet connection or GPS, the app predicts the user's location by using the scheduled stops time table. It also shows a slideshow of the photos I took during my ride associated to a specific stop.
