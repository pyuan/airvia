AirVIA
======

An Adobe air/actionscript app I worked on the train during a 4-day train ride from Toronto to Vancouver. The app shows approximately the location of the rider on a map with information about the elapsed trip time and remaining trip time. Due to the constraint of the trip, without any internet connection or GPS, the app predicts the user's location by using the scheduled stops time table, then dynamically draws the location over a photograph of a map which I took from the back of the time table brochure. It also shows a slideshow of the photos I took during my ride associated to a specific stop.
